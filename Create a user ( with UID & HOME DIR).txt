For some security reasons xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted there rather than its default user. 
Since this is going to be the Apache user so it shouldn't use the default home directory. 

Create the user as per requirements given below:


a. Create a user named kareem on the App server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

b. Set UID to 1869 and its home directory to /var/www/ryan



sudo useradd -u 1869 -d /var/www/kareem ryan
              |       |			  |
      userid(UID)     home directory     user

Login to AppServer First: ssh tony@stapp01

	
    1  sudo useradd -u 1869 -d /var/www/ryan ryan
    2  cat /etc/passwd
       ryan:x:1869:1869::/var/www/kareem:/bin/bash  -- 
    3  cd /var/
    4  ls
    5  sudo mkdir www
    6  cd www/
    7  sudo mkdir ryan
    8  ls -la
    9  sudo chown -R ryanryan/
   10  ls -latr
